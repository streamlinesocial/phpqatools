This composer metapackage is meant to provide a composer file that allows us to
use composer to install the PHP QA toolset we want without the need to use PEAR.

The toolset is derived from the phpqatools.org site.

Usage

Clone or download repo to directory.

Run composer install.

Add the bin dir to the $PATH for users or servers looking to use these tools.
